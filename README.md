React Native Network Info API for Android, iOS, macOS & Windows. It allows you to get information on:

* Connection type
* Connection quality

## Getting started
Install the library using either Yarn:

```
yarn add @react-native-community/netinfo
```

or npm:

```
npm install --save @react-native-community/netinfo
```

#### Using React Native >= 0.60
Linking the package manually is not required anymore with [Autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md).

- **iOS Platform:**

  `$ npx pod-install` # CocoaPods on iOS needs this extra step

- **Android Platform with Android Support:**

  Using [Jetifier tool](https://github.com/mikehardy/jetifier) for backward-compatibility.

  Modify your **android/build.gradle** configuration:
  ```
  buildscript {
    ext {
      buildToolsVersion = "28.0.3"
      minSdkVersion = 16
      compileSdkVersion = 28
      targetSdkVersion = 28
      # Only using Android Support libraries
      supportLibVersion = "28.0.0"
    }
  ```

- **Android Platform with AndroidX:**

  Modify your **android/build.gradle** configuration:
  ```
  buildscript {
    ext {
      buildToolsVersion = "28.0.3"
      minSdkVersion = 16
      compileSdkVersion = 28
      targetSdkVersion = 28
      # Remove 'supportLibVersion' property and put specific versions for AndroidX libraries
      androidXCore = "1.0.2"
      // Put here other AndroidX dependencies
    }
  ```

- **macOS Platform:**

  Autolinking is not yet available on macOS.  See the [Manual linking steps for macOS](#manual-linking-macos) below.

#### Using React Native < 0.60

You then need to link the native parts of the library for the platforms you are using. The easiest way to link the library is using the CLI tool by running this command from the root of your project:

```
react-native link @react-native-community/netinfo
```

If you can't or don't want to use the CLI tool, you can also manually link the library using the instructions below (click on the arrow to show them):

<details>
<summary>Manually link the library on iOS</summary>

Either follow the [instructions in the React Native documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios#manual-linking) to manually link the framework or link using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) by adding this to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'react-native-netinfo', :path => '../node_modules/@react-native-community/netinfo'
```

<summary>Manually link the library on Android</summary>

Make the following changes:

#### `android/settings.gradle`
```groovy
include ':react-native-community-netinfo'
project(':react-native-community-netinfo').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@react-native-community/netinfo/android')
```

#### `android/app/build.gradle`
```groovy
dependencies {
   ...
   implementation project(':react-native-community-netinfo')
}
```

#### `android/app/src/main/.../MainApplication.java`
On top, where imports are:

```java
import com.reactnativecommunity.netinfo.NetInfoPackage;
```

Add the `NetInfoPackage` class to your list of exported packages.

```java
@Override
protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
    return Arrays.asList(
            new MainReactPackage(),
            new NetInfoPackage()
    );
}
```

        {
            new MainReactPackage(),
+           new RNCNetInfoPackage(),
        };
```

</details>

## React Native Compatibility
To use this library you need to ensure you are using the correct version of React Native. If you are using a version of React Native that is lower than `0.57` you will need to upgrade that before attempting to use this library.

| `@react-native-community/netinfo` version | Required React Native Version                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `4.x.x` & `5.x.x`                         | `>= 0.60` or `>= 0.59` if using [Jetifier](https://github.com/mikehardy/jetifier) |
| `3.x.x`                                   | `>= 0.59`                                                                         |
| `2.x.x`                                   | `>= 0.57`                                                                         |
| `1.x.x`                                   | `>= 0.57`                                                                         |

## Browser Compatilibity
The web implementation heavily depends on the [Network Information API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Network_Information_API) which is still an is an experimental technology and thus it's not supported in every browser.
If this API is not available the library will safely fallback to the old [onLine](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorOnLine/onLine) property and return basic connection information.

## Migrating from the core `react-native` module
This module was created when the NetInfo was split out from the core of React Native. To migrate to this module you need to follow the installation instructions above and then change you imports from:

```javascript
import { NetInfo } from "react-native";
```

to:

```javascript
import NetInfo from "@react-native-community/netinfo";
```

Note that the API was updated after it was extracted from NetInfo to support some new features, however, the previous API is still available and works with no updates to your code.

## Usage
Import the library:

```javascript
import NetInfo from "@react-native-community/netinfo";
```

Subscribe to network state updates:

```javascript
// Subscribe
const unsubscribe = NetInfo.addEventListener(state => {
  console.log("Connection type", state.type);
  console.log("Is connected?", state.isConnected);
});

// Unsubscribe
unsubscribe();
```

Get the network state once:

```javascript
NetInfo.fetch().then(state => {
  console.log("Connection type", state.type);
  console.log("Is connected?", state.isConnected);
});
```

## API
* **Types:**
  * [`NetInfoState`](#netinfostate)
  * [`NetInfoStateType`](#netinfostatetype)
  * [`NetInfoCellularGeneration`](#netinfocellulargeneration)
* **Methods:**
  * [`fetch()`](#fetch)
  * [`addEventListener()`](#addeventlistener)
  * [`useNetInfo()`](#usenetinfo)

### Methods

#### `configure()`

Configures the library with the given configuration. You only need to supply the properties which you want to change from the default values.

Note that calling this will stop all previously added listeners from being called again. It is best to call this right when your application is started to avoid issues.

**Example:**
```javascript
NetInfo.configure({
  reachabilityUrl: 'https://clients3.google.com/generate_204',
  reachabilityTest: async (response) => response.status === 204,
  reachabilityLongTimeout: 60 * 1000, // 60s
  reachabilityShortTimeout: 5 * 1000, // 5s
  reachabilityRequestTimeout: 15 * 1000, // 15s
});
```

#### `addEventListener()`

Subscribe to connection information. The callback is called with a parameter of type [`NetInfoState`](README.md#netinfostate) whenever the connection state changes. Your listener will be called with the latest information soon after you subscribe and then with any subsequent changes afterwards. You should not assume that the listener is called in the same way across devices or platforms.

| Parameter   | Type                                                          | Description                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `listener`  | `(state: `[`NetInfoState`](README.md#netinfostate))` => void` | The listener which will be called whenever the connection state changes |

**Example:**
```javascript
// Subscribe
const unsubscribe = NetInfo.addEventListener(state => {
  console.log("Connection type", state.type);
  console.log("Is connected?", state.isConnected);
});

// Unsubscribe
unsubscribe();
```

#### `useNetInfo()`

A [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) which can be used to get access to the latest state. It returns a hook with the [`NetInfoState`](README.md#netinfostate) type.

**Example:**
```jsx
import {useNetInfo} from "@react-native-community/netinfo";

const YourComponent = () => {
  const netInfo = useNetInfo();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Type: {netInfo.type}</Text>
      <Text>Is Connected? {netInfo.isConnected.toString()}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

You can optionally send configuration when setting up the hook. Note that configuration is global for the library, so you shouldn't send different configuration for different hooks. It is instead recommended that you called `NetInfo.configure()` once when your project starts. The hook option is only provided as a convinience.

```jsx
const YourComponent = () => {
  const netInfo = useNetInfo({
    reachabilityUrl: 'https://clients3.google.com/generate_204',
    reachabilityTest: async (response) => response.status === 204,
    reachabilityLongTimeout: 60 * 1000, // 60s
    reachabilityShortTimeout: 5 * 1000, // 5s
    reachabilityRequestTimeout: 15 * 1000, // 15s
  });

  // ...
};
```

#### `fetch()`

Returns a `Promise` that resolves to a [`NetInfoState`](README.md#netinfostate) object.

**Example:**
```javascript
NetInfo.fetch().then(state => {
  console.log("Connection type", state.type);
  console.log("Is connected?", state.isConnected);
});
```

You can optionally send an `interface` string so the `Promise` resolves to a [`NetInfoState`](README.md#netinfostate) from the [`NetInfoStateType`](#netinfostatetype) indicated in `interface` argument.

```javascript
NetInfo.fetch("wifi").then(state => {
  console.log("SSID", state.details.ssid);
  console.log("BSSID", state.details.bssid);
  console.log("Is connected?", state.isConnected);
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Errors when building on Android

This library was migrated from using the support library to AndroidX in version `4.0.0`. All of your depenencies must be using either the support library *or* AndroidX. Using a mixture of the two is not possible.

From React Native 0.60 AndroidX is used by default.

If you need to either convert this library back to the support library (to use an older React Native version) or convert other libraries forward to use AndroidX (if they have not been updated yet), you can use the [Jetifier](https://github.com/mikehardy/jetifier) tool.

### Errors while running Jest tests

If you do not have a Jest Setup file configured, you should add the following to your Jest settings and create the `jest.setup.js` file in project root:

```js
setupFiles: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js']
```

You should then add the following to your Jest setup file to mock the NetInfo Native Module:

```js
import mockRNCNetInfo from '@react-native-community/netinfo/jest/netinfo-mock.js';

jest.mock('@react-native-community/netinfo', () => mockRNCNetInfo);
```

### Issues with the iOS simulator

There is a [known](http://openradar.appspot.com/14585459) [issue](http://www.openradar.appspot.com/29913522) with the iOS Simulator which causes it to not receive network change notifications correctly when the host machine disconnects and then connects to Wifi. If you are having issues with iOS then please test on an actual device before reporting any bugs.
